**Evaluate Argentinians saving decisions between USD and Crypto ðŸ’¸**     


Due to high inflation rates, Argentinians have historically made the choice of saving their income in stronger currencies.

Although the US dollar has always been the favorite choice, thanks to cryptocurrency there are now more options available.

Have you ever asked yourself the question "**What if I had Invested in Cryptocurrencies before**"?

Using this API you will be able to select an amount of Argentinian pesos, a cryptocurrency and date in order to check how much your investment would be worth today.
In order to give more context, it will also check how many US Dollars you would have been able to save with that amount of pesos at that date.
